# Unextractable Bash write target honors only the session ticket

> The ticket-gate hook `require-active-ticket.sh` blocked an unextractable Bash write target, even with an active ticket. I decided to check only the ops-level `current-ticket` marker for that target, skipping the per-worktree and per-project tiers. An active session ticket now gates the write. No new exemption exists. The target still cannot use a per-project or per-worktree marker, because it carries no project to resolve them against.

## Context

`active_ticket_marker_for_path` (in `_lib-active-ticket.sh`) resolves the
marker that governs a write target. Some Bash targets cannot be parsed. For those, the function received an
empty path. It returned an empty marker before it checked
`current-ticket`. The gate then blocked the write, even with an active
ticket. The hook's header comment says that such a target falls through
to the ticket gate.

Two commands hit this. One was an in-place sed edit on a variable path.
The other was an archive export into a scratch directory
(me2resh/apexyard#1396, me2resh/apexyard#1402).

Commit `56aacc0` (#1231) moved this marker lookup into the shared library
and added the early return that caused the regression. Before that
refactor, an empty target still reached `current-ticket`. This fix
restores that earlier behavior. It does not widen the gate.

## Options Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Exempt an unextractable target from the gate entirely | Simplest change | Widens a security gate — any write the detector cannot parse would bypass the ticket requirement, reopening the class of bypass #151 closed |
| Skip only the per-worktree/per-project tiers, and still check `current-ticket` | Matches the header comment's stated intent. Adds no new exemption. An unextractable target still needs an active session ticket. | The target cannot bind to a project marker. A session with only a per-project marker still blocks an unextractable target. |
| Block unextractable targets with no fallback at all (status quo) | No behavior change | Contradicts the hook's documented intent. Blocks a session that already declared a ticket. Forces the Edit or Write tool for a valid Bash write. |

## Decision

Chosen: **skip only the per-worktree and per-project tiers, and still
check `current-ticket`**. This is the smallest change that restores the
documented behavior. An active session ticket still gates the write. The
write is never exempted.

## Consequences

- An unextractable Bash write target now honors the session's
  `current-ticket` marker, closing the false-block reported in
  me2resh/apexyard#1396.
- A per-worktree or per-project-only marker (no `current-ticket`) still
  does not satisfy an unextractable target, because the target carries no
  project to resolve those tiers against. A session with only a
  per-project ticket still blocks an unextractable write for that
  project. This is unchanged and intentional.
- `require-migration-ticket.sh` shares the same library function, but it
  never sends a fully empty target. The gate exits before the library
  runs whenever it cannot extract any target at all.
- A tilde-spelled migration target (`~user/`, `~+/`, `~-/`) is a
  different case. It stays a non-empty string through normalisation. The
  resolver returns an empty path for it. An earlier commit in this PR let
  that case fall through to the ops-level `current-ticket` marker. That
  marker could approve a write meant for a different project
  (me2resh/apexyard#1159's wrong-ticket approval). Hakim's security
  review on PR #1404 flagged this as finding H1. A follow-up commit in
  this PR restores the fail-closed behavior. The function now returns an
  empty marker when a non-empty target fails to resolve.
