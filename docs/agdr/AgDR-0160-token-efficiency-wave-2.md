# Load rule bodies on demand

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Wave 1 (AgDR-0044, #322) shortened skill blurbs and the CLAUDE.md skill table.
Wave 2 from that record did not ship.

On `dev` at `3953d50` Claude Code always-on load was about 43.1k tokens
(chars÷4). That figure is CLAUDE.md (7,720) plus 15 `@`-imported rule files
(33,286) plus skill `description:` strings (2,145). The 15 files are:

`agdr-decisions`, `agent-role-selection`, `evidence-grounding`,
`git-conventions`, `glossary-lookup`, `isolated-builds`, `loop-mode`,
`plan-mode`, `pr-workflow`, `reconcile-before-build`, `reporting-style`,
`right-size-ceremony`, `role-triggers`, `skill-first`, `ticket-vocabulary`.

The other seven rule files were already on-demand. CLAUDE.md also restated
the imported rules in the Quality Rules block. The `@.claude/rules/*.md`
string in CLAUDE.md sat inside backticks. It did not glob-import 22 files.
A 53.7k figure that summed CLAUDE.md plus all 22 rule files overstated the
Claude Code load by about 10k tokens. Ticket #1319 inherited that error.

Hard gates already live in `.claude/hooks/*.sh`. #1317 and #1318 cut hook
latency. They did not cut this catalogue.

Parent record: AgDR-0044.

## Decision

Make CLAUDE.md an index. Do not auto-import rule bodies at session start.

- Keep every file under `.claude/rules/`.
- Name each rule in CLAUDE.md.
- Instruct the agent to Read a named file when the work needs it.
- Do not use `@.claude/rules/` paths in CLAUDE.md. Claude Code would import them.
- Keep a few one-line load-bearing formats in CLAUDE.md (branch, PR title,
  no `git add -A`, no push to `main`).
- Keep the Wave 1 skill table.
- Keep mechanical gates in hooks.
- Keep AGENTS.md as a short operator bridge plus a path table. Do not copy
  the full rule bodies into AGENTS.md. Cursor, pi, Codex, and opencode load
  AGENTS.md. That file must stay an index, not a second restatement.

## Consequences

Agents will not see the full text of every rule on every turn. They must
Read the named file when the work matches. A missed Read is a real risk.
Hooks still block ticket-first edits, merge without markers, secrets, leak
protection, and `git add -A`. Advisory rules with no hook (evidence
grounding, plan mode, right-size ceremony, reporting style) now depend on
that Read.

The Claude Code always-on catalogue becomes CLAUDE.md plus skill
`description:` strings. Rule bodies drop out of the session-start load.
Chars÷4 does not measure prompt-cache hits. The per-turn marginal cost of
the old imports is unverified.

Cursor still runs `.claude/hooks/*.sh` when third-party configs are on. The
`.cursor/rules/apexyard.mdc` overlay stays a short pointer. It must not tell
the agent to ingest every rule file.

The Wave 2 test caps CLAUDE.md plus skill descriptions at 9,000 tokens. It
caps AGENTS.md at 5,000 tokens. Those caps bind near the measured values.

Wave 3 from AgDR-0044 (shared SKILL.md preamble extraction) stays out of
scope.

Naqid challenged this record (advisory). Verdict: proceed-with-changes.
This file now uses the 43.1k composition, a binding test cap, and a shorter
AGENTS.md index.

## Options considered

| Option | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Index in CLAUDE.md. Load rule bodies on demand. Keep none of the long bodies always-on. | Accepted. It cuts the catalogue without removing primitives. Hooks stay the gates. |
| Keep a core set of rule files always imported and defer the rest. | Rejected. Any always-imported body re-grows the tax. The index plus hooks already cover the floor. |
| Keep the current restatement and glob-style imports. | Rejected. Wave 1 already took the cheap compression. The remaining cost is structural. |
| Delete the restatement and keep the 15 `@` imports. | Rejected as a stopping point. It leaves the import tax. It is the control arm that shows the adherence risk is worth watching after merge. |

## Correction (2026-09-21) — #1354

Wave 2 assumed that removing `@.claude/rules/` imports from `CLAUDE.md`
was enough to drop rule bodies from the session-start catalogue. That
assumption was false.

Claude Code also auto-loads every markdown file under `.claude/rules/`
as project memory. It does this without any `@` path and without a
`paths:` frontmatter filter. The measured cost on #1354 was about
175 KB (~44k tokens) of rule text on every session, including the three
regression fixture files that lived under `.claude/rules/tests/`.

**Corrected decision**

1. Keep the CLAUDE.md index and the "Read on demand" instruction from
   this record.
2. Add `"claudeMdExcludes": ["**/.claude/rules/**"]` to
   `.claude/settings.json` so Claude Code does not inject rule bodies
   at session start.
3. Keep fixtures and rule smoke tests outside `.claude/rules/` so they
   cannot re-enter the auto-load tree if the exclude is removed.
4. Agents still `Read` a named rule file when the work needs it.

Removing `@` imports alone remains necessary. It is not sufficient.
The exclude is the mechanical control. The fixture move is defence in
depth.

## Scope note (2026-09-25) — #1355

Rex reviewed PR #1355 and found a wider effect than the correction above
states. This section records that effect and the decision to accept it.

`claudeMdExcludes` matches absolute file paths, not project-relative
paths. A read of the Claude Code 2.1.282 binary and its settings
schema confirmed that Claude Code applies one merged exclude list
across User, Project, and Local memory for a session. A picomatch
test confirmed the path match itself: the pattern
`**/.claude/rules/**` matched `/Users/u/.claude/rules/personal.md` (a
personal rule file outside this repository) and
`/Users/u/ops/workspace/app/.claude/rules/x.md` (a managed project's
own rule file). The same pattern did not match `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
or a project-root `CLAUDE.md`. It matches a `CLAUDE.md` file only
when that file sits inside a `.claude/rules/` directory, for example
`~/.claude/rules/CLAUDE.md`.

A narrower pattern cannot fix this in a settings file that stays checked
into git. A narrower pattern needs an absolute-path anchor, such as a
literal fork directory name. CLAUDE.md's PORTFOLIO MODEL section says a
fork commonly gets a different name on clone (for example `ops`). An
anchor on one clone's path is wrong on every other clone.

Moving every rule body out of `.claude/rules/` would remove the exclude.
A repository-wide search found more than 260 files that name that path
in prose or in code. A move at that size does not fit inside one
bug-fix PR. #1388 keeps this move on record as a rejected alternative,
for the same reference-count reason.

**Decision:** keep `"claudeMdExcludes": ["**/.claude/rules/**"]` in
`.claude/settings.json` for now. Accept the wider match as a known
limitation. The tracked follow-up is #1388: write the exclude per
clone, into the gitignored `.claude/settings.local.json`, using this
clone's own absolute path (`"<absolute ops-root>/.claude/rules/**"`),
instead of the shared pattern in the checked-in `settings.json`.
`/setup` writes that entry once, and a SessionStart hook repairs it if
the clone moves. Once #1388 ships, this scope note and the CLAUDE.md
and harness-doc warnings can come out.

**Effect an adopter must know, until #1388 ships:**

1. Personal rules at `~/.claude/rules/*.md` do not load in this ops
   fork, and do not load in a registered `workspace/<project>` opened
   from inside it. Workaround: put personal instructions in
   `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` instead. The exclude pattern does not match a
   `CLAUDE.md` file outside a `.claude/rules/` directory.
2. A managed project's own `.claude/rules/*.md`, if the project ships
   one inside `workspace/<project>/`, also does not load while the
   session runs from inside this ops fork. No exclude-side workaround
   exists yet. A managed project that needs its rules always loaded
   should keep that content in its own `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`
   instead.

See me2resh/apexyard#1355 for the review that found this scope, #1388
for the tracked fix, and CLAUDE.md plus `docs/harnesses/claude-code.md`
for the operator-facing statement of the same trade-off.
