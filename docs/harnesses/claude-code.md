# Harness support — Claude Code

**Status:** Native — the reference harness. Full experience, gates enforced live.

Claude Code is ApexYard's reference harness. Nothing is translated: `CLAUDE.md` loads at session start, bash hooks run on real tool calls, skills are typed slash commands, and agents start with their own tool restrictions. Features described as "delegated" or "planned" on other harness pages are native here.

## What "full experience" means

- **`CLAUDE.md` auto-load** — the Chief-of-Staff framing, SDLC, workflow gates, and a named index of `.claude/rules/` load at session start. Rule bodies do **not** auto-load: `.claude/settings.json` sets `claudeMdExcludes` for `**/.claude/rules/**`, and agents Read a named file when the work needs it. Removing `@` imports alone is not enough (Claude Code also injects `.claude/rules/**/*.md` as project memory). The same exclude pattern matches absolute paths, so it also drops a personal `~/.claude/rules/` file and a managed project's own `workspace/<name>/.claude/rules/` file from the session — a known, accepted trade-off, tracked in #1388; put personal instructions in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` instead. See AgDR-0160 (the 2026-09-21 correction for #1354 and the 2026-09-25 scope note for #1355).
- **Mechanical gates fire on every tool call** — the `.claude/hooks/*.sh` scripts wire to `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` / `SessionStart` via `.claude/settings.json` and block (exit 2) or advise (exit 0) in real time.
- **Slash-command skills** — each `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` is a typed `/command` (e.g. `/start-ticket`, `/decide`, `/code-review`, `/approve-merge`).
- **Sub-agents** — Rex (code review), Hakim (security), Tariq (design review), Naqid (the contrarian), plus the department personas, each spawned via the `Agent` tool with role-scoped tools.
- **Session markers + memory** — review approvals live under `.claude/session/reviews/*.approved`; the ops-root session pin (`~/.claude/apexyard/ops-root-<session>`) protects against wrong-fork resolution (apexyard#381); per-project auto-memory persists across sessions.

## What's enforced vs advisory today

**Mechanically enforced (blocking):** the two-marker merge gate (Rex + CEO), red-CI merge block, ticket-first edits, migration-ticket-first edits, design-review gate for UI PRs, architecture-review gate for design-artifact PRs, secrets scanning, private-ref leak protection, branch-name and PR-title validation, and AgDR-for-architecture-change prompts.

**Advisory (non-blocking reminders):** role-trigger banners (`detect-role-trigger.sh`), upstream-drift notices, MCP-reindex-after-clone/-pull nudges, and the self-discipline rules (plan mode, parallel-work/fan-out offers, loop mode, reporting style).

## How it works (transport)

There is no transport layer for Claude Code itself. Cursor can load the same `.claude/` files when third-party configs are on. See [cursor.md](cursor.md). The hooks read tool-call JSON on stdin, decide, and return an exit code the harness honors. `.claude/` is the canonical authoring surface for every other harness because Claude Code executes it natively.

## How to install

Fork `me2resh/apexyard`, clone it, run `/setup`, and register projects with `/handover`. The `.claude/` directory is picked up automatically. Full walkthrough: [`docs/getting-started.md`](../getting-started.md); portfolio model: [`docs/multi-project.md`](../multi-project.md).

## Preconditions

None beyond a working Claude Code install. The hooks are wired natively via `.claude/settings.json` and fire on every tool call — no adapter, no install flag, and (unlike the delegating adapters) no trust/approval precondition to satisfy first. The single OS-level prerequisite: on Windows the bash hooks need Git Bash / WSL.

## What's verified

Enforcement is native and exercised continuously — every gate in this framework runs against Claude Code itself on every session. This is the reference surface the other adapters are measured against.

## Gaps + tracking

None specific to Claude Code — it is the feature-complete baseline. The one cross-cutting limitation is OS-level: on Windows the hooks require Git Bash / WSL (a documented prerequisite, not a silent failure — see [AgDR-0086](../agdr/AgDR-0086-hooks-stay-bash-not-ported.md)).
