    title System Context for ApexYard

    Person(ops, "CEO / Chief of Staff / Tech Lead", "Solo operator running a portfolio of projects. The 'user' of ApexYard.")
    Person(contributor, "Contributor", "Framework author pushing upstream changes. Usually the same human as the ops role, but a distinct hat.")

    System(apex, "ApexYard (fork)", "Governance, workflow, and SDLC primitives for a managed project portfolio. Lives as a GitHub fork in the user's org; clone is the ops repo.")

    System_Ext(claude, "Claude Code CLI", "The execution environment. Reads CLAUDE.md, runs hooks, invokes skills, spawns sub-agents.")
    System_Ext(cursor, "Cursor IDE", "Loads the same .claude/ runtime when third-party configs are on. Overlay maps session_id onto CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID.")
    System_Ext(github, "GitHub", "Hosts the ops fork, hosts every managed project, hosts all issue trackers. Merge gates, CI, PR reviews all live here.")
    System_Ext(projects, "Managed Projects", "The N repos under the ops repo's registry. Each has its own GitHub repo, its own issues, its own CI. ApexYard governs them; it does not host them.")
    System_Ext(upstream, "me2resh/apexyard (upstream)", "The canonical ApexYard framework. The ops fork pulls from here periodically via /update.")

    Rel(ops, apex, "Uses daily", "gh + Claude Code or Cursor")
    Rel(ops, claude, "Invokes", "terminal")
    Rel(ops, cursor, "Invokes", "IDE")
    Rel(claude, apex, "Reads CLAUDE.md, runs hooks, invokes skills")
    Rel(cursor, apex, "Loads .claude/settings.json natively, runs the session-pin overlay")
    Rel(apex, github, "Reads issues, opens PRs, posts reviews, merges", "gh CLI")
    Rel(apex, projects, "Governs via the registry (apexyard.projects.yaml)")
    Rel(contributor, upstream, "Contributes back to", "PRs")
    Rel(apex, upstream, "Syncs from periodically", "/update skill")

## How to read this

- **The user is the ops role.** Whoever runs Claude Code in the ops fork. In a solo setup that's one person wearing many hats; in a team setup it's a small group.
- **ApexYard itself is a collection of docs, hooks, skills, and registries.** Claude Code is the reference runtime. Cursor can load the same `.claude/` files when third-party configs are on. Without one of those harnesses, ApexYard is markdown.
- **GitHub is the source of truth** for tracker state, PR state, merge state. ApexYard never holds state that should live in GitHub — the approval markers in `.claude/session/reviews/` are session-local and gitignored.
- **Managed projects are first-class external systems.** ApexYard does not ingest their code; it points at them via the registry. Their own git history, CI, and issues stay in their own repos.

## Why these relationships matter

- `ops → apex` **via Claude Code or Cursor** — the user edits ApexYard files through a harness that already speaks git and gh, not through a proprietary UI.
- `apex → github` — the single integration point. No Jira, no Linear, no Notion. If you want ApexYard to feel different, the work lives in adding GitHub integrations, not in replacing GitHub.
- `apex → upstream` **via /update** — the fork-sync path. Without `/update`, forks silently drift (PRD-0002 problem #1). The SessionStart drift banner ensures the user knows when to invoke it.

## What this diagram does NOT show

- Internal structure of ApexYard (hooks, skills, agents, rules, workflows) — that's the L2 container diagram in `apexyard-container.md`.
- Deployment topology — ApexYard doesn't "deploy." It lives in the user's local clone and on GitHub.
- The flow of a specific feature from idea to production — that's the SDLC, documented in `workflows/sdlc.md` as a sequence, not a context diagram.

## Maintenance

Should change only when a major new external dependency enters or leaves. Candidates:

- If ApexYard ever gains a first-class Linear / Jira integration → add those as external systems
- If the managed-project model is replaced or extended (unlikely) → re-draw the boundary
- If a new first-class harness runtime joins Claude Code (Cursor did, 2026-09-16) → add it as an external system

Target: no more than one or two updates per year.
