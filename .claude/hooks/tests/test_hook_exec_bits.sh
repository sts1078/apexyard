# Guard against #1008 — a directly-invoked hook committed non-executable.
#
# Bug shape: .claude/hooks/reindex-on-session-start.sh was committed with
# mode 100644 (non-executable), but its SessionStart wiring in
# .claude/settings.json invokes it via `exec "$r/.claude/hooks/<name>.sh"`,
# which requires the execute bit. Every session start on a fresh clone
# failed with "Permission denied" — and because a mode-only change produces
# an EMPTY content diff, the regression is invisible in a normal code
# review (`git diff` shows nothing to look at).
#
# This test closes that blind spot mechanically: every hook settings.json
# invokes via `exec "$r/.claude/hooks/<name>.sh"` MUST be committed 100755
# in git's index. After AgDR-0157, Bash PreToolUse also execs the scripts
# named in dispatch-bash.sh's APEXYARD_DISPATCH_GATE table. Those delegated
# gates must stay in this set. A lost exec bit now returns 126, and the
# dispatcher warns and continues, so an unwatched 100644 file fails open.
# It deliberately does NOT check the `_lib-*.sh` files — those are
# `source`d by other hooks, never exec'd directly, so 100644 is correct
# for them (see #1008's own notes + the six 100644 files audited during
# the fix: five _lib-*.sh + this one).
#
# Cases covered:
#   1. Every hook exec'd from settings.json or the dispatcher table is
#      100755 in the git index
#   2. No _lib-*.sh file is accidentally required to be 100755 by this test
#      (negative control — confirms the extraction logic doesn't overreach)
#   3. Named trust-chain gates remain in the extracted set after the
#      dispatcher collapses SessionStart wiring (#1317, #1318)
#
# Exit 0 if all cases pass; 1 on first failure.
