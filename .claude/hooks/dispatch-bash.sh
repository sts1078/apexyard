# `set -e`, sourcing a file that EXISTS but is unreadable makes the `.`
# builtin fail, and the whole dispatcher then exits with that failure's
# code (1) before any merge gate has run. Claude Code only blocks a tool
# call on exit 2, so an unreadable library used to let every Bash command
# through unblocked, not just merges — a silent fail-open, not a fail-closed
# exit 1 as the exit code alone might suggest.
#
# A file that is MISSING entirely is a tolerated partial-install case:
# is_merge_command stays undefined, and the fail-closed check further down
# this script still runs the merge gates on any merge-shaped command. A file
# that EXISTS and cannot be READ is a different, more suspicious case — a
# broken permission or a tampered file, not a partial install — so it gets
# an explicit block instead of silently falling through to that same path.
