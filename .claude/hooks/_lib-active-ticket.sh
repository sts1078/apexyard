  # #1396: an empty $resolved has two distinct causes, and they must NOT
  # reach the ops-level fallback the same way.
  #
  #   1. $raw was ALSO empty. The caller passed an unextractable Bash write
  #      target (bash_extract_write_targets couldn't parse it, or the tool
  #      call carried no file_path at all). There is no path anywhere to
  #      gate on, so the ops-level current-ticket fallback below still
  #      runs and an active session ticket gates the write (the #1396 fix).
  #   2. $raw was NON-empty but still failed to resolve -- a `~user/`,
  #      `~+/` or `~-/` target. `_at_resolve_path` refuses those on
  #      purpose: their expansion depends on the caller shell or the
  #      passwd database, neither of which this hook can observe safely.
  #      This target names a SPECIFIC, real path this hook just can't
  #      read; it must return an EMPTY marker here, exactly like it did
  #      before the #1396 fix, so the migration gate still refuses it
  #      instead of falling through to whichever ticket happens to be
  #      active for a DIFFERENT project (H1 on PR #1404, restores #1159's
  #      fail-closed guarantee for this spelling).
  #
  # The project and per-worktree tiers below both depend on a resolved
  # path (there is no project to look up otherwise), so they are
  # naturally skipped whenever `project` stays empty.
