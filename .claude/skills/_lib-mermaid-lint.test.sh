#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Test suite for _lib-mermaid-lint.sh and its per-skill wrappers
# (c4/lint.sh, dfd/lint.sh, feature-diagram/lint.sh, tech-vision/lint.sh,
# handover/lint.sh, plan-initiative/lint.sh).
#
# Coverage:
#   - Clean Mermaid block       → exit 0
#   - Broken Mermaid block      → exit 1     (only if Node + mmdc are available)
#   - Multiple blocks, one bad  → exit 1
#   - No Mermaid blocks         → exit 0
#   - --skip-lint               → exit 0     (no work performed)
#   - Missing file              → exit 2
#   - Unknown flag              → exit 2
#   - Node missing              → exit 3     (graceful degrade)
#   - Each per-skill wrapper dispatches to the shared lib (clean + no-blocks)
#   - handover/SKILL.md and plan-initiative/SKILL.md state the "Mermaid not
#     validated" warning (me2resh/apexyard#1382 point 4 — no silent skip)
#
# Skips parse-assertion tests when npx is not available — same graceful
# degrade the lib itself implements.
#
# Usage:  bash .claude/skills/_lib-mermaid-lint.test.sh
